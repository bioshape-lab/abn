This module is directly copied from [s-vae-pytorch](https://github.com/nicola-decao/s-vae-pytorch/blob/master/hyperspherical_vae/distributions/hyperspherical_uniform.py)

However, I believe we will want to redo our own implementations in Geomstats in the future, so we can use their implementations as a starting point and guide.
